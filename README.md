**Required:**
JRE 17 or higher;
Gradle installed / supported with IDE 

**Optional:**
It's better to install the 'Lombok' plugin in your IDE to avoid error messages, but it will work without it.

**Steps to run:**
You can run all test by running command line command:   ./gradlew :test --tests "JUnitTestSuite"  
No additional parameters required.

**Note:**
Two tests will fail because of the server side problems (see test comments)
